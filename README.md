# Rainfall_prediction

Task:
As an ML expert at The Daily Buzz, you are given the task to create a ML model to predict the
rainfall. So, you have to create a Machine Learning Model using various Classification Models
including Decision Trees and Ensemble methods, and compare the accuracy of each model.
First Load the data and perform data preprocessing and after data cleaning use decision tree
classification and then use Bagging And Boosting techniques along with the Random Forest
Classifier then find out the accuracy score of each and create a confusion matrix to evaluate the
performance. After completing this, take your best model and write why this model performed
better than other models and in what ways you can further improve the accuracy of the selected
model.
You have to share the .ipynb file in which you will perform all of the required steps this file
should also contain the answer of following question (you can use markdown option to answer
these questions in same notebook)
1. Your views about the problem statement?
2. What will be your approach to solving this task?
3. What were the available ML model options you had to perform this task?
4. Which model’s performance is best and what could be the possible reason for that?
5. What steps can you take to improve this selected model’s performance even further?
